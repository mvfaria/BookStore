# BookStore
An online books store sells books for 3 different categories: Crime, Romance, Fantasy.

Currently all books within the Crime category are discounted by 5%
Total tax for the whole order is 10%

## The task
Write a simple console application that outputs the total order cost with and without tax for
the below purchase:

| Book name | Category | Total Cost |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
| Unsolved crimes | Crime | 10.99 |
| A Little Love Story | Romance | 2.40 |
| Heresy | Fantasy | 6.80 |
| Jack the Ripper | Crime | 16.00 |
| The Tolkien Years | Fantasy | 22.90 |

## Guidelines
1. The application should be runnable in Visual Studio / Code via F5
2. The code should be accessible on the public/private Git repo.
